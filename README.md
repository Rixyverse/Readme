Welcome to the FAQ of Rixyverse!

If you are reading this, you most likely have some questions. If your question isn't here, then open an issue and we will respond to your question shortly.

Note from the 16 August, 2021:
Project development is back.

## What is this?
This is a Miiverse Clone, a social media created to recreate the experience of Miiverse, but better.

## Why did you make this??? Miiverse Clones are a waste of time!!!!
Sure, they are, but sometimes it's just fun to make.
If you say otherwise, it's fine. You can hate or love Miiverse clones. It really doesn't matter.

## I love your project! How I can help you?
When the project becomes open-source, you will be able to participate to the developement by opening a pull request. For now, you can't help us without becoming a beta tester.

## How can I become a beta tester?
Well, go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjwP-8l-KvVKI_pkhStSh-CET-zILfTNoRvYAPwawGsHf_5w/viewform">this link</a> and then complete the form. You need to be in <a href="https://clonemii.webs.nf">CloneMii</a> to send the form. You need an invite key to get into CloneMii at this present time.

## When will the source code/the site will be publicly available?
Around January-March 2022.

# That's all for now!
