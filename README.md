## What is that?
This is a Miiverse Clone, a social media created to recreate the experience of Miiverse, but better.

## Why did you make this??? Miiverse Clones are a waste of time!!!!
SHUT UP.

## I love your project! How I can help you?
When the project becomes open-source, you will be able to participate to the developement by opening a pull request. For now, you can't help us without becoming a beta tester.
